Adaptive Observation Window Strategy

Initial fixed observation windows (30–90 days) produced churn rates exceeding
industry expectations due to strong end-of-dataset effects.

To ensure a realistic churn distribution (20–40%), an adaptive temporal
window selection strategy was implemented. Multiple observation windows
were evaluated, and the first window producing a valid churn rate was selected.

Final Configuration:
- Observation window: 120 days
- Churn rate: 36.4%

This approach preserves strict temporal integrity while aligning with
real-world churn behavior.
