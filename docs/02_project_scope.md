# Project Scope

## In Scope
- Customer-level churn prediction
- Feature engineering using transactional data
- RFM and behavioral analysis
- Multiple machine learning model evaluation
- Deployment of a prediction application

## Out of Scope
- Real-time prediction systems
- Product recommendation engines
- Inventory optimization
- Dynamic pricing strategies

## Timeline
**Total Duration:** 8 weeks  
- Data preparation and feature engineering
- Model development and evaluation
- Deployment and documentation

## Constraints
- Use of **free and open-source tools only**
- No paid APIs or services
- Public deployment required
- Limited to historical transactional data

## Assumptions
- Historical customer behavior is predictive of future churn
- A 90-day inactivity window is sufficient to define churn
- Data quality after cleaning is reliable for modeling
